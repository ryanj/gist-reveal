# Gist-Reveal

## Gist-powered Revealjs presentations

[Gist-Reveal.it](http://gist-reveal.it/) is an open source slideshow templating service that makes it easy to create, edit, present, and share [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) slides on the web by using github's [gist](http://gist.github.com) service as a datastore.

#### gist-reveal.it/YOUR_GIST_ID

Store any Revealjs-compatible [HTML](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markup) or [Markdown](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markdown) content in a [gist](http://gist.github.com), then [append your resulting gist id to the end of any gist-reveal site url](http://gist-reveal.it/af84d40e58c5c2a908dd#/try-it) to view the resulting presentation:

    http://gist-reveal.it/GIST_ID_CONTAINING_REVEALJS_SLIDE_CONTENT
    
Example:

    http://gist-reveal.it/af84d40e58c5c2a908dd

Use [bitly](http://bit.ly) or another url shortener to make these long urls easier to share, and to make enagement rates easier to count.

#### gist-reveal.it/bit.ly/SHORTNAME

Creating a [bit.ly](http://bit.ly) shortname for your longer `gist-reveal/gist_id` deck urls will also make your presentations available at an alternate presentation path:

    http://gist-reveal.it/bit.ly/SHORTNAME
    
Example:

    http://gist-reveal.it/bit.ly/k8s-workshops
    
Much nicer!  Make sure to continue sending traffic to the shorter `bit.ly/shortname` url for metrics collection purposes.

## Gist-powered Slideshow Themes

Available CSS themes include [the default reveal.js list of themes](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/themes), but can be easily extended by storing new themes [in a gist](https://gist.github.com/450836bbaebcf4c4ae08b331343a7886):

 * [a dark winter theme](http://gist-reveal.it/?theme=60e54843de11a545897e#/themes)
 * [the revealjs black theme](http://gist-reveal.it/?theme=black#/themes)
 * [the revealjs simple theme](http://gist-reveal.it/?theme=simple#/themes)
 * [the revealjs league theme](http://gist-reveal.it/?theme=default#/themes)
 * [the revealjs sky theme](http://gist-reveal.it/?theme=sky#/themes)

Conference organizers can host their own modified gist-reveal templating service (with its own default theme), to provide a consistent look for all presentations at an event.

### Application Config

The following environment variables can be used to autoconfigure the application:

Variable Name  | Contents   |  Default Value
---------------|------------|---------------
DEFAULT_GIST   | The default gist id slideshow content for the site | [af84d40e58c5c2a908dd](https://gist.github.com/ryanj/af84d40e58c5c2a908dd)
REVEAL_THEME | The site's default theme. Should be a locally bundled theme name, or a remote gist_id. | [450836bbaebcf4c4ae08b331343a7886](https://gist.github.com/ryanj/450836bbaebcf4c4ae08b331343a7886) 
GH_CLIENT_SECRET | GitHub client secret | unset
GH_CLIENT_ID | GitHub client ID | unset
GA_TRACKER | Google Analytics tracker token | unset
PORT | The server port number | 8080
IP_ADDR | The server IP address | 0.0.0.0
GIST_THEMES | Allow reveal.js CSS themes to be installed dynamically "url/?theme=gist_id". Disable this feature by setting this config to the string "false". | "true"
REVEAL_SOCKET_SECRET | the site's broadcast token (alphanumeric) | randomly generated

See [`server.js`](https://github.com/ryanj/gist-reveal/blob/master/server.js#L55-L70) for more information about the site's configuration options.

### Broadcasting Slide Transitions

Administrators can configure the application's `REVEAL_SOCKET_SECRET` to broadcast slide transitions using Reveal's [socket Multiplexing support](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#multiplexing).

Presenters who know the site's `REVEAL_SOCKET_SECRET` value can configure their browser as a presentation device using the `setToken` querystring param:

    http://YOUR_REVEAL_HOST_URL/?setToken=REVEAL_SOCKET_SECRET_VALUE

This token will be stored in the browser's `localStorage` area (per host url) as `localStorage.secret`. To reconfigure your browser as a client device (as a listener), use the `clearToken` querystring param:

    http://YOUR_REVEAL_HOST_URL/?clearToken

## Running Gist-Reveal.it
Gist-reveal makes it easy to run your own Gist-powered RevealJS slideshow service

### Local Development

The simplest way to get started with this project, is to clone a copy of the source from github (`git clone http://github.com/ryanj/gist-reveal && cd gist-reveal`), then run the app locally with `npm install` followed by `npm start`.

### Kubernetes 
Create a kubernetes `pod` and `service`, both named `gist-reveal`:

```bash
kubectl run gist-reveal --image=ryanj/gist-reveal --expose --port=8080 \
--env="DEFAULT_GIST=YOUR_DEFAULT_GIST_ID" \
--env="GH_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_GH_CLIENT_SECRET" \
--env="GH_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GH_CLIENT_ID" \
--env="REVEAL_SOCKET_SECRET=0P3N-S0URC3" \
--env="GA_TRACKER=YOUR_GA_TRACKER"
```

### Podman or Docker

Run [the container image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/ryanj/gist-reveal/) locally on port `8080`:

```bash
podman run --rm -p 8080:8080 ryanj/gist-reveal
```

[Environment variables](#application-config) can be passed into the container to configure the websocket relay, or to change the default slideshow content:

```bash
podman run --rm -p 8080:8080 -e "REVEAL_SOCKET_SECRET=0P3N-S0URC3" -e "DEFAULT_GIST=YOUR_DEFAULT_GIST_ID" ryanj/gist-reveal
```
